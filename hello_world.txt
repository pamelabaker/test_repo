again

this is my first branch

how to fetch and access other branches:

ginger: git fetch origin
From github.com:pamelabaker/test_repo
 * [new branch]      test_fetch -> origin/test_fetch
ginger: git branch
  feature_1
* master
ginger: git checkout test_fetch
Branch test_fetch set up to track remote branch test_fetch from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'test_fetch'
